In this section, you need to convince the assessors that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well.
Essentially, in this part, you should go over all of your project's features, and ensure that they all work as intended,
with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Feature-by-Feature Testing:

Go through each feature of your portfolio site and detail the testing process for each.

Explain the functionality and demonstrate how it aligns with the intended purpose. This could include:

- Navigation: Ensuring smooth transitions between pages, links directing to the correct destinations.
- Responsive Design: Checking for compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- Portfolio Display: Verifying that projects are properly showcased with accurate descriptions, images, and links.
- Contact Form: Testing the form submission process, ensuring the user receives a confirmation, and you receive the message.

User Experience Testing:

- Usability Testing: Have users (or simulated users) interact with the site and provide feedback. Document any issues encountered and the resolutions implemented.
- Accessibility Testing: Confirm compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., screen reader compatibility, proper alt text for images, keyboard navigation).

Compatibility Testing:

- Browser Compatibility: Testing on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.) to ensure consistent performance.
- Device Compatibility: Ensuring functionality across various devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones).
- Performance Testing (optional):
	- Speed and Load Testing: Tools like PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix to check page load times and optimize where necessary.
	- Scalability Testing: Assess how the site handles increased traffic or usage.

Regression Testing:

After implementing fixes or updates, ensure that previous features and functionalities still work as intended. This prevents new changes from breaking existing features.

Documentation and Logs:

Maintain records of testing procedures, results, and any bugs encountered along with their resolutions. This helps demonstrate a systematic approach to testing and problem-solving.
User Feedback Incorporation:

If applicable, mention how user feedback has been taken into account and implemented to enhance the user experience.

## Code Validation

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use the space to discuss code validation for any of your own code files (where applicable).
You are not required to validate external libraries/frameworks, such as imported Bootstrap, Materialize, Font Awesome, etc.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide a screenshot for each file you validate.

**PRO TIP**: Always validate the live site pages, not your local code. There could be subtle/hidden differences.

## Browser Compatibility

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various browsers.

Consider testing at least 3 different browsers, if available on your system.

Recommended browsers to consider:
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/download)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested browsers, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Please note, there are services out there that can test multiple browser compatibilities at the same time.
Some of these are paid services, but some are free.
If you use these, you must provide a link to the source used for attribution, and multiple screenshots of the results.

Sample browser testing documentation:

## Responsiveness

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.

The minimum requirement is for the following 3 tests:
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested responsiveness, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Using the "amiresponsive" mockup image (or similar) does not suffice the requirements.
Consider using some of the built-in device sizes in the Developer Tools.

If you have tested the project on your actual mobile phone or tablet, consider also including screenshots of these as well.
It showcases a higher level of manual tests, and can be seen as a positive inclusion!

## Lighthouse Audit

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample Lighthouse testing documentation:

## Defensive Programming

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must enter valid email addresses

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
- Users must choose from a specific list only

MS3 (Flask) | MS4/PP4/PP5 (Django):
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).

You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

Testing should be replicable.
Ideally, tests cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website.
Each test case should be specific, objective, and step-wise replicable.

Instead of adding a general overview saying that everything works fine,
consider documenting tests on each element of the page
(ie. button clicks, input box validation, navigation links, etc.) by testing them in their happy flow,
and also the bad/exception flow, mentioning the expected and observed results,
and drawing a parallel between them where applicable.

Consider using the following format for manual test cases:

Expected Outcome / Test Performed / Result Received / Fixes Implemented

- **Expected**: "Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y."
- **Testing**: "Tested the feature by doing Y."
- (either) **Result**: "The feature behaved as expected, and it did Y."
- (or) **Result**: "The feature did not respond to A, B, or C."
- **Fix**: "I did Z to the code because something was missing."

Use the table below as a basic start, and expand on it using the logic above.

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

| Page | Expectation | Test | Result | Fix | Screenshot |

Another way of performing defensive testing is a simple Pass/Fail for each test.
The assessors prefer the above method, with the full test explained, but this is also acceptable in most cases.

When in doubt, use the above method instead, and delete the table below.

Testing user stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **features** should already align with the **user stories**,
so this should as simple as creating a table with the user story, matching with the re-used screenshot
from the respective feature.

### GitHub **Issues**

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

An improved way to manage bugs is to use the built-in **Issues** tracker on your GitHub repository.
To access your Issues, click on the "Issues" tab at the top of your repository.
Alternatively, use this link: https://github.com/Mel0Dramat1c/You-All-Start-In-A-Tavern/issues

If using the Issues tracker for your bug management, you can simplify the documentation process.
Issues allow you to directly paste screenshots into the issue without having to first save the screenshot locally,
then uploading into your project.

You can add labels to your issues (`bug`), assign yourself as the owner, and add comments/updates as you progress with fixing the issue(s).

Once you've sorted the issue, you should then "Close" it.

When showcasing your bug tracking for assessment, you can use the following format:

## Unfixed Bugs

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

> [!NOTE]  
> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
